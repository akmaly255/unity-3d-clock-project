# Unity Graph Visualizer

This is a learning project based on Jasper Flickâ€™s [Catlike Coding Unity tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/).  
It explores procedural graph generation and real-time animation using `Time.time`, C# delegates, and the Unity Engine.

## What I Learned
- Graphing functions in Unity
- Using delegates for runtime function selection
- Procedural point generation with `Instantiate`
